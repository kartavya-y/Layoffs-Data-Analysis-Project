# Layoff Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project aims to analyze layoff data from various companies across different industries and locations. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations to uncover insights and trends in the layoff data.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about layoffs, including:
- Company name
- Location
- Industry
- Total number of employees laid off
- Percentage of employees laid off
- Date of the layoff event
- Company stage (e.g., Series A, Post-IPO)
- Country
- Funds raised


## Data Cleaning and Preparation

 The following steps were followed to clean the data
-  Check for duplicates and remove any
-  Standardize data and fix errors
-  Looking at null values
-  Remove any columns and rows that are not necessary  

## Exploratory Data Analysis  

### Layoff Trends Over Time

An analysis of layoffs over time revealed variations in the number of layoffs across different years. 2023 exhibited an unusual spike in layoff numbers, suggesting the influence of external factors or seasonal trends on layoffs, most probably the consequence of extra hiring during the previous years i.e after covid during the economic upcycle due to which the layoff cycle was much harsher.

### Industry Analysis

The industry analysis highlighted that the `Tech`, `Retail`, and `Finance` sectors experienced the highest total layoffs. Furthermore, the average percentage of layoffs was notably high in the `Tech` and `Startup` industries, indicating significant workforce reductions in these sectors.

### Geographical Analysis

Geographically, the `United States`, `India`, and `Canada` reported the highest number of layoffs. At the city level, locations such as `San Francisco`, `New York`, and `Bengaluru` were most affected, reflecting major hubs for industry and business.

### Company Stage Analysis

Examining layoffs by company stage revealed that companies at the `Post-IPO` and `Series D` stages had the highest layoffs. A notable relationship was observed between higher funds raised and more layoffs, particularly in these stages, suggesting financial factors influencing layoff decisions.

### Top Companies by Layoffs

The top companies with the most significant layoffs included prominent names such as `Company A`, `Company B`, and `Company C`. Additionally, companies like `Company D` and `Company E` had the highest layoff percentages, indicating drastic reductions in their workforce.

### Correlation Analysis

A positive correlation was found between the funds raised and the total number of layoffs, indicating that companies that raised more funds also tended to lay off more employees.

## Visualizations

The following visualizations were created to illustrate the insights:

- **PowerBI** for data visualization

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of layoff data, uncovering key trends and insights that can help stakeholders understand the factors influencing layoffs across different industries and regions. The visualizations created in PowerBI further enhance the understanding of the data and support informed decision-making.
